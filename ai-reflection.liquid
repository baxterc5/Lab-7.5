        <p>During this lab, I used both ChatGPT 4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to assist me in building this demo website. There were definitely times when I was struggling to get the output that I wanted and also some circumstances where the code they both gave me broke the site as a whole, but once I got going, they both proved to have some really effective uses in the end.</p>
        <p>Initially, I wanted to see if I could explain to ChatGPT what the project was and have it write me some code for the index.liquid. It was able to give me a very simple page that technically contained what I asked for, but you could definitely tell that it wasn’t made by a person because the containers for every post and user filled the entire screen. Following that since it needed a lot of refinement, I started to ask Claude ultra specific questions telling it exactly how I wanted something to look, tiny sections at a time. For example, I wanted something as simple as making the Read More buttons to be light blue, so I told Claude, “make the color for the button styling blue-200.” While it made the correct changes, I found it really frustrating that I couldn’t ask it to do multiple things at once. When I had attempted to, it would either ignore one half of the request, or it would randomly break the site.</p>
        <p>Pleasantly, I did find that when it came to implementing the posts and users from DummyJSON and setting up the layout.liquid for using Tailwind and Alpine it did a great job. It immediately gave me the correct setup, which is very simple to do yourself, but having it done for me was faster. Another thing it did well was when I accidentally made the liquid page for my reflection in the wrong spot and it wasn’t linking when I was previewing it on the local server, I just asked, “Why is my reflection page not showing when I load the website?” and it told me immediately where I needed to move the file and also that I had an s in the file name that I hadn't included in the actual code to link it in the navigation.</p>
